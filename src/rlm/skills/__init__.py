"""Built-in skills shipped with rlm, enabled per run via ``RLM_SKILLS``.

Each built-in skill is a module here exposing an async ``run(...)`` (the same contract as an
uploaded skill). When enabled, a thin re-export module is written into the session directory
(on the kernel's ``sys.path``) so the kernel pre-imports it by name — the same path MCP-tool
skills take (see ``rlm.mcp``). The agent then calls it from IPython, e.g. ``await edit(...)``.
